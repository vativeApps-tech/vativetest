1 const does not change its value and non const variable change his value once its intialized
const variables are evaluated at compile time and are more efficient in terms of performance.
but when you need a variable that can change his value you should not declare as const 


void main() {
  const a = 'abc';
  a  = 'nicssss';
}
when you are change const value this error occurs
compileDDC
main.dart:3:3: Error: Can't assign to the const variable 'a'.
  a  = 'nicssss';
